All mod developers interested in why I've forked 1.3K repositories, READ THIS!
---
I am creating a minecraft mod (a single .jar file) combining most/all of the mods that I have forked to elimanate incompatabilities. In addition, all mods are being ported to 1.19 fabric so that I don't have to switch between versions to play all of these mods. If you take issue with me using your mod in my mod and it is not listed under any license or I missed a repository marked all rights reserved, please contact me at anihacc#9612 on discord.

I TREAT ALL REPOSITORIES WITHOUT A LICENSE AS OPEN SOURCE. UNLESS CONTACTED, I WILL USE THE FORKED MOD.
