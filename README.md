# Ultimacraft-project-public-notice
All mod developers interested in why I've forked 1.3K repositories, READ THIS!
---
I am creating a minecraft mod (a single .jar file) combining most/all of the mods that I have forked to elimanate incompatabilities. In addition, all mods are being ported to 1.19 fabric so that I don't have to switch between versions to play all of these mods. If you take issue with me using your mod in my mod and it is not listed under any license or I missed a repository marked all rights reserved, please contact me at anihacc#9612 on discord or open up an issue with the RMM tag here.

As raised by the first issue in this repository, the name is a major point of contention. I will happily accept new names in the same ways as licensing issues, but if you are opening an issue, instead of the RMM tag, please use the name suggestion tag.

!!UPDATE!! I have removed every mod without any mention of a license and can finally start the project! I'll deal with the "other" and licenses I don't recognize as I encounter them while I code
