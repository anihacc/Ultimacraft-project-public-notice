# Ultimacraft-project-public-notice
All mod developers interested in why I've forked 1.3K repositories, READ THIS!
---
I am creating a minecraft mod (a single .jar file) combining most/all of the mods that I have forked to elimanate incompatabilities. In addition, all mods are being ported to 1.19 fabric so that I don't have to switch between versions to play all of these mods. If you take issue with me using your mod in my mod and it is not listed under any license or I missed a repository marked all rights reserved, please contact me at anihacc#9612 on discord or open up an issue with the RMM tag here.

As raised by the first issue in this repository, the name is a major point of contention. I will happily accept new names in the same ways as licensing issues, but if you are opening an issue, instead of the RMM tag, please use the name suggestion tag.

!!UPDATE!! It has been a year! A whole year of ADHD distraction, schedule changes, and trying to figure out where to go with my life. Mostly distraction- Now that I'm settled into somewhat of a routine, I think I'm going to finally START this hobby project of mine. Ultimacraft (Name pending, ideas wanted)! Over the next couple of weeks, I'll be setting up my computer to do coding livestreams on my Youtube channel! I can't guarantee a defined schedule sadly, but come watch me learn to code (And more than likely model) this absolute mountain of a project over at: www.youtube.com/@anihacc

I am not planning to stream on twitch anymore for a variety of reasons, but I do plan to create some sort of engagement system to hook into Youtube chat for all of you.

I would be happy to accept other developers to this project at a later date, once I have a firmer grasp on how to do coding solo at the bare minimum. Anyone who joins will be added to the credits, and we'll plan for a custom item for each developer added to the project! In addition, the developers will probably have the only copies of this project, as releasing it publically seems like a hassle. I am currently debating a modrinth release, which will be taken down at the first cease and desist, as I have no plan to go into legal battles over a hobby project. I'm more worried about the mods without licenses and/or those protected under copyright than anything, as even though I haven't forked them (Or they were closed source to begin with, for example, thaumcraft) I do plan to take some inspiration from them. Any mods where I have code reference will be properly attributed in a credits tab on the main menu according to their license.

On a note unrelated to Ultimacraft, as I am a V-tuber, I'm always on the lookout for trusted artists who I can commission to upgrade my V-tuber model, as it does feel a bit basic to me! If you're an artist, please, don't hesitate to get in touch with me! Though, I'm not sure how I should go about that, as I am less likely to trust people who contact me over discord, due to scammers pretending to be artists and 3D modelers contacting me on a near regular basis. I am considering Bluesky, so I'll let you know if I decide to join!

Thanks and see you soon!
